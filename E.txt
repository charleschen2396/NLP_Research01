Abstract: 

In recent years, suicide of college students has been a 
universal phenomenon in the world. And the phenomenon 
has become more and more sever because of the complex 
and drastic competitions. With the popularization of 
internet and the development of information processing 
technologies, a lot of people have established their own 
blog websites to write down their experiences and express 
their feelings at times. It will be very helpful if the 
computer can recognize the emotions expressed in blog 
pages automatically. And then it will be convenient for 
teachers or psychological consultants to monitor the 
affective 
information of college students and 
take 
measures for the depression prevention when necessary. 
Owing to the advances in Affective Computing and 
Natural Language Processing, researches have begun to 
pay more attention to the emotion recognition in NLP all 
over the world. This paper outlines the approach we have 
developed to construct a Blog Emotion-Recognizing 
System. It is based on the lexical contents of words and 
structural characteristics of blog articles. For the emotion 
computing of articles, two methods are proposed and the 
experimental results are compared and analyzed. Finally, 
the implications of the results are discussed for the 
future’s direction of the research.

Introduction 

In recent years, suicide of college students has 
been a universal phenomenon all over the world. 
Furthermore, the number of college students who 
suicide themselves has been increasing with amazing 
speed in a worldwide scope, around 100 million persons 
every year. In 
the year of 2003, World Health 
Organization (WHO) appointed September 10th as 
“World Suicide Prevention Day (WSPD)” to give a 
caution to the society. And it has adopted many suicide 

978-1-4244-2780-2/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE 

prevention programs and projects to avoid unnecessary 
death. At the same time, the problem of mental health 
among college students has raised great attention from 
more and more psychologists, educators and people in 
all the other professions.  
In order to intervene in the crisis, psychological 
consultation centers have been set up almost in every 
university or college [1]. However, some college 
students are afraid 
to 
talk about 
their private 
experiences with other people face to face, and refuse to 
consult psychological consultants when they meet 
troubles. 
In late decades, the popularization of internet and 
the development of information processing technologies 
have greatly changed the communication ways of 
mankind. More and more people have established their 
own blog websites over the internet where they write 
down their experiences, put forward their opinions, and 
express their feelings at times. While some people feel 
embarrassed to confide their troubles to others face to 
face, they may feel free to express their emotions in 
blogs without any pressures. 
It can be anticipated that in the near future, almost 
everyone in the world especially every college student 
will possess his or her own blog website. At that time, it 
will be very helpful if the computer can recognize the 
emotions expressed in blog articles automatically. In 
this case, a Blog Emotion-Recognizing System is 
needed. If the system detects that some college student 
has been in a blue mood for continuous days (for 
example, for continuous seven days), it is recommended 
that the teacher should pay more attention lately and 
have a talk with him or her regularly so that the 
depression can be treated in time. That’s why this 
research has been taken on. 
In this paper, we outline a new approach to 
recognize the author ’s emotion from his or her blog 
articles. Based 
on 
the 
approach, 
a Blog 
Emotion-Recognizing System has been constructed. 
The results of our experiments on blogs prove the 
feasibility and effectivity of the means. The remaining 
part of the paper is organized as follows:

2. Affective computing and natural language 
processing 

With the progress in human-computer interface 
technology 
and 
the 
involvement of 
computer 
applications in our daily life, it becomes more and more 
important that human can communicate with computer 
in a natural way. Recognizing human's emotional states 
can be very helpful to smooth the interaction between 
human and computer. One of the famous researchers, 
Picard brought forward the concept of “affective 
computing”[2] at first. After that, machine emotional 
intelligence has drawn great attention from scientists 
and researchers not only in the area of artificial 
intelligence, but also in psychology and others [3]. They 
have devoted 
to 
extracting human’s 
affective 
information in many ways such as text, voice, facial 
expressions, gestures and even some psychological 
phenomena like galvanic skin response, temperature, 
heart rate, perspiration rate and etc [4] [5].  
At the same time, recent technological advances 
have allowed 
to develop better applications of 
human-computer interface to assess human’s emotional 
states [6] [7]. One of the representative applications is 
the 
emotion-recognizing 
system 
used 
in 
a 
teleconference, which provides real-time information on 
the emotional states of 
the participants. Another 
example is an automatic tutoring application. It can 
automatically adjust the content and the speed of the 
tutorial depending on whether the learner feels bored or 
excited. 
Among all the communication mediums (like text, 
voice, facial expressions, and gestures), we should not 
forget that language and text play a very basic and 
important role in expressing our emotions during daily 
communications, and textual information is easily 
accessed in pervasive electronic documents like emails, 
web pages, electronic newspaper and so on. With the 
help 
of Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) 
technologies, emotional states under the text can be 
assessed. And in turn, the emotion recognition in text 
will enhance 
the emotion 
sensing 
from other 

communication mediums.  
Owing to the popularization of Internet and the 
development of studies on affective computing, 
researches have begun to pay more attention to the 
emotion recognition in NLP especially in America and 
Japan[8] [9] [10]. In these years, Chinese NLP has also 
become one of the most attractive focuses in the field of 
artificial 
intelligence 
[11] 
[12]. 
In our Blog 
Emotion-Recognizing System, the NLP technologies 
are certainly of great use for the emotion recognition 
from blog articles. 

3. Emotion classification for words 

It is not a trivial task to extract emotional 
information from the lexical content or meaning of the 
words in a blog. The fundamental component of the 
Blog Emotion-Recognizing System is the emotional 
dictionary through which the emotional category of a 
vocabulary can be 
looked up. And 
the emotion 
classification has a direct influence on the efficiency 
and accuracy of the emotion sensing. However, there is 
no standard 
for 
the classification of emotions. 
Researchers grouped affective words into categories 
defined by their own for specific study or use.  
In the past, emotion has been simply divided into 
two categories “pleasure” and ”displeasure” which are 
too ambiguous to assess rich emotions of human. 
Ekman has defined 7 universal affective categories [13] 
based on unique facial expressions which seem still less 
while applied into a practical system. In contemporary 
Chinese, 39 emotional categories are specified for 
vocabulary [14], nevertheless part of which is seldom 
used in daily communications.

In our Blog Emotion-Recognizing System, we 
classified emotion based on the affective categories 
defined by Ekman plus some important categories 
found in blogs with high frequency of use. They are 
totally 26 categories: happy, sad, fearful, disgusted, 
angry, surprised, love, expectant, nervous, regretful, 
praiseful, shy, respectful, proud, impatient, doubtful, 
hateful, grievance, critical, depressed, exited, thankful, 
annoyed, scornful, haughty, envious. When there is no 
emotion expressed in a blog, we named the mental state

as “neutral”. Some examples of emotional vocabularies 
are listed in Table 1. 

4. Model of blog emotion-recognizing system 

The Blog Emotion-Recognizing System 
is 
composed of five modules: HTTP Downloading, HTML 
Parser, Morphological Analyzing, Emotion Tagging, 
Emotion Computing. The framework of the model is 
illustrated by Figure 1. In the following we will 
introduce the flow of how the system works step by 
step.

Figure 1. Framework of the blog 
emotion-recognizing system 

Firstly, 
the System will download 
the blog 
webpage through Internet according to the web address 
(URL) of the blog which is inputted from keyboard. 
Secondly, the HTML Parser module analyzes the 
blog webpage that has been downloaded, and extracts 
each blog article in the webpage. Then it divides the 
blog article into paragraphs and sentences which are 
stored for further processing. 
Next, for each natural language sentence, the 
Morphological Analyzing module will analyze the 

lexical characteristics of the sentence and extract words 
from it based on the rule database according to analyzer 
rules. Here we select the ICTCLAS (Institute of 
Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis 
System) system for this module for its high segment 
accuracy in Chinese natural language. 
And then in the Emotion Tagging module, Emotion 
Dictionary is used to search for the emotion category of 
a word. In our system, we only check words with 
certain part of speech as keywords in the sentence. They 
are the adjective, adverb, verb, idiom and habitual 
words which are rich in emotions. Totally 7393 words 
are included in the Emotion Dictionary, collecting from 
People’s Daily tagging corpus and other dictionaries 
such as Xiandaihanyu Dictionary. The output of the step 
is the emotion category of each sentence. 
Finally, with the emotion category of each sentence, 
the Emotion Computing module will compute the 
weight value of emotion categories of all sentences in a 
blog article according to the blog structure rules, and 
output the emotion result for the whole article. In our 
system, we have tried two methods to realize this 
module which will be analyzed in detail in the later part 
of the paper. 

5. Analysis of blog articles 

From the emotion sensing of sentences to the 
emotion recognition of an article, there is still a 
complex way to go. With only the emotion category 
based on the lexical information of words, the emotion 
expressed by the whole article can not be assessed 
correctly. In order to achieve the aim, the information of 
structural characteristics [15] [16] of blog articles must 
be acquired.  
Here it is assumed that there exits a central 
sentence which expresses the emotion of the whole 
article, and the central sentence is likely to locate in a 
certain place in the article with high probability. Then 
we choose 40 most recent articles of two blog authors 
with 20 articles for each. The blog authors are selected 
randomly under the blog community in some university. 
Next, we mark the central sentence expressing the 
emotion of each article manually, and assess the 
emotion into one of the 26 categories mentioned in 
Section 3. Table 2 demonstrates the most probable 
distributions of the central sentence throughout the 
articles. Here are some abbreviated symbols used in the 
table: 
PCS: The paragraph where the central sentence is 
located. 
NTP: The number of total paragraphs. 
LCS: The location of the central sentence. 
NTS: The number of total sentences in PCS. 
E: Emotion evaluated by human.

From the distribution of the central sentence in 
Table 2, we obtain the structural weight values for a 
blog article as showed in Table 3. We can see from 
Table 2 that the central sentence which expresses the 
emotion of the whole article tends to locate in three 
places mainly: the title, the last paragraph, and the first 
paragraph in a decreasing order of weight. 
The central sentence also appears in other places 
like the last second paragraph, the second paragraph, 
and the last third paragraph, and etc. It is of more 
probability for the central sentence to be in the 
paragraphs near the two ends of an article than the 
paragraphs near the middle. But there are no obvious 
rules to follow for the occurrence in these places. 
It can only be discovered that while the central 
sentence is located in the last paragraph, the last 
sentence in the paragraph is the central sentence in most 
cases; and while the central sentence appears in the first 
paragraph, the first sentence in the paragraph is usually 
the central sentence. For other paragraphs, 
last 
sentences in last paragraphs are more important than the 
ones from the beginning; and the sentences at the 
beginning in first paragraphs are more important than 
the ones from the end. 

6. Basic idea of two methods 

From the analysis of blog articles in Section 5, we 
acquired the structural characteristics of blog articles. 
Making use of the structural information, two different 
methods are tried to compute the emotion in order to get 
better results. The critical problem in the emotion 
computing is how to find out the main emotion among 
all the emotions extracted from all the paragraphs and 
sentences in a blog article. 

6.1. Method 1 

The basic idea of Method 1 is to add all the 
emotion weight values obtained from all the sentences, 
and the emotion category with the biggest weight value 
is the main emotion of a blog article.  
Let us suppose that there are i (i=0,1,2,…n) 
paragraphs in a blog article (here i=0 denotes the title of 
the article) and j (j=1,2,3, …m) sentences in each 
paragraph (m is variable for different paragraphs).  
For each sentence j in each paragraph i, there is a 
emotion weight value Wij assigned. When i=0, the 
weight Wij is 0.35 as listed in Table 3. When i=1, it 
denotes the first paragraph, and the weight Wij is 0.175. 
When i=n, it denotes the last paragraph, and the weight 
Wij is 0.2. For other paragraphs, the weight is averagely 
assigned as (1-0.175-0.2) / (n-3).  
Each sentence j in a paragraph i corresponds to a 
pair (Ek, Wij). Ek is one of the 26 emotion categories 
(k=1,2,…26). Ek with the maximum sum of all the

corresponding Wij (i=0,1,2,…n and j=1,2,3, …m) is the 
emotion of the whole article. 

6.2. Method 2 

The basic idea of Method 2 is to try a direct way to 
find out the main emotion of a blog article by searching 
for the central sentence according to the proportion of 
distribution in the article.  
We check for the main emotion in the order of title, 
the last paragraph, the first paragraph, the last second 
paragraph, the first second paragraph and so on. This is 
for the reason analyzed in Section 5 that the central 
sentence tends to appear in the paragraphs near the two 
ends of an article than the paragraphs near the middle. 
For last paragraphs, the searching is from the end of the 
paragraph to the beginning. For the first paragraphs, the 
searching order is from the beginning to the end.  
Once the emotion which appears first is extracted 
in the searching, it is the main emotion of a blog article. 
The emotion weight for each paragraph is the same as in 
Method 1. 

7. Experiments and evaluation 

It is still an issue for the evaluation. By now there 
is not a good evaluation method generally accepted. 
Since different people may have different opinions even 
on the same text, it is common for them to give different 
evaluations of emotion manually. In our experiments, 
we carried on the close test and open test based on the 
manual evaluation of emotions as a standard set which 
is judged by evaluators in advance. 

7.1. Close test 

The close test is carried out on 40 blog articles of 
two blog authors which are used to obtain the structural 
characteristics in Section 5. Two algorithms (Method 1 
and 2) of emotion computing are realized in our system. 
And the evaluation is to count the number of correct 
prediction by the system compared with the standard set. 
Table 4 gives a list of all the evaluation results on the 
close test. The data in the table with the background of 
grey color is the incorrect prediction of emotion 
according to the standard set. And the percentages of 
correct prediction by two methods are listed in Table 5 
respectively. Here are some abbreviated symbols used

blog authors (different from the two blog authors in the 
close test). These blog articles are new ones that are not 
used in acquiring the structure information. Similarly, 
two methods of emotion computing are tried in the test 
in the same way as in the close test. Table 6 
demonstrates all the evaluation results. The data in the 
table with the background of grey color is the incorrect 
prediction of emotion according to the standard set. And 
the percentages of correct prediction by two methods 
are listed in Table 7 respectively.

7.3. Comparison and discussion 

In comparing the two methods for extracting 
emotion from a blog article, we can see that Method 1 
achieves a better performance than Method 2. However, 
Method 1 spends much more time than Method 2 doing 
the emotion computing. As shown in Figure 2, the solid 
line denoting emotion prediction of Method 1 
demonstrates more richness and accuracy in emotion 
description than the dot-dash line denoting that of 
Method 2. The data used in Figure 2 come from the first 
10 articles of one blog author in Table 4. 
The visual image of the emotion changes for 10 
days can be easily obtained from Figure 2. If teachers or 
psychological consultants have the emotion graph 
everyday, they can monitor the mental situations of 
college students and intervene to prevent the depression 
in time. 

Figure 2. Comparison of two methods of  
emotion computing 

By analyzing the incorrect predictions of emotion, 
we can see that for both of the two methods, there exit 
some articles in which the emotion of the central 
sentences can not be sensed for the lack of vocabularies 
in the emotion dictionary or the lack of the syntax 
information. 
For Method 1, the cases of incorrect prediction are: 
When the weight value of some emotion category 
(different from the emotion of the central sentence) 
becomes the biggest after added throughout the whole 
article, this emotion category will be the emotion of the 
article. However, since Method 2 detects the emotion 
according to the importance of paragraphs, in some 
cases it gives the correct answer directly and quickly. 
When 
the weight values of several emotion 
categories appear to be the same, Method 1 can not 
predict the emotion of the article correctly. 
For Method 2, the cases of incorrect prediction are: 
Because the searching order in Method 2 is fixed, 
the emotion first met in the article is probably not the 
emotion of the central sentence. 
When 
the manual evaluation of emotion 

is 

“neutral”, Method 2 can only examine one of all the 
emotions throughout the whole article as the emotion of 
the article, while Method 1 can examine all the 
emotions throughout the whole article instead of a 
simple “neutral”. 
In the experiments for testing, we choose 40 
articles of two blog authors for close test and 40 articles 
of other blog authors for open test. The result has 
demonstrated that the methods used in our system are 
reasonable, and the integration of the two methods may 
achieve a better performance. 

8. Conclusions and future work 

Recently, the number of college students who 
suicide themselves has been increasing with amazing 
speed in the world. The problem of mental health 
among college students has raised greater attention from 
a 
lot of people 
in many professions. With 
the 
popularization of internet and the development of 
information processing technologies, more and more 
people have established their own blog websites. It will 
be convenient for teachers or psychological consultants 
to monitor the affective information expressed in blog 
articles in order to prevent the depression of students. 
The advances in Affective Computing and Natural 
Language Processing enable the emotion recognition 
from blog articles automatically.  
In this paper, we have outlined the approach to 
develop a Blog Emotion-Recognizing System. Firstly 
we decided 
the classification of emotions, and 
introduced the model of the System. Based on the 
lexical contents of words and structural characteristics 
of blog articles, two methods have been proposed for 
emotion computing. The experiments for testing have 
been carried out, and the results for the two methods 
were analyzed and discussed. The approach was proved 
to be feasible and pointed out the future’s direction of 
the research. 
From 
the 
comparison 
and discussion of 
experimental results, we find that some parts need to be 
improved in the future: 
The first task to improve the emotion dictionary by 
expanding the vocabularies and arranging them better, 
for it plays a very important role in the emotion sensing. 
Since different people have different styles in 
writing blog articles, in the future we will choose more 
blog articles of different authors for the algorithm 
analysis and system test, which are supposed to achieve 
a better performance.
